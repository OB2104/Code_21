# Code_21
This project is about building, training, and evaluating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow for customer churn prediction based on a dataset (Churn_Modelling.csv). It follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and prediction.


Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Importing Libraries
The first cell imports necessary libraries:

numpy – For numerical computations.

pandas – For handling datasets.

tensorflow – For building and training the ANN.

The project builds a neural network to predict customer churn, starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It uses label encoding, feature scaling, and ANN with TensorFlow to classify customers as likely to churn or not.
